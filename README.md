# Basic-Portfolio

As I mentioned in my bio, I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Rutgers University. Our first homework assignment was to build a 3 page portfolio using HTML and CSS. This mini-site included a home page, a portfolio page, and a contact page. Though the navigational links and social media links are live, the links for each portfolio project are dead.  

Screenshots of my three pages are displayed below:
